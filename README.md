<hr/>

Be The Hero is a project destined to the **Heroes** that want to help ONG'S to help and care of animals.


##  ðŸ’» Project

The project was developed with the aim of helping people and also getting to know new front and back end technologies.

## ðŸš€ Technologies
This project was developed with the following technologies:

- Node.js
- React
- React Native
- Expo

## Getting Started

To facilitate the management of the parts of the project I use Yarn, so it is possible to manage the dependencies and start the development environments using the following commands:

First install the dependencies:
```
yarn
```

start each one separately

```
cd backend
yarn start
```

```
cd frontend
yarn start
```

```
cd mobile
yarn start
```

Pronto!
